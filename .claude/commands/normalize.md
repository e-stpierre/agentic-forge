# Normalize Command

Validate that prompt files and plugin READMEs conform to the exact structure defined in the template files:

- `docs/templates/command-template.md` for commands
- `docs/templates/agent-template.md` for agents
- `docs/templates/skill-template.md` for skills
- `docs/templates/readme-template.md` for plugin READMEs

**Template Convention:**

All templates use Mustache/Handlebars-style placeholders (`{{placeholder_name}}`) with HTML comment instructions. See `CLAUDE.md` section "Prompt Template Convention" for complete details.

## Arguments

- **`--autofix`** (optional): Automatically modify files to make them compliant with the templates. Without this flag, only reports issues.
- **`file-or-directory`** (optional): One or more paths to files or directories to validate. If omitted, validates all prompt files and READMEs in the repository.

## Objective

Ensure all prompt files and plugin READMEs exactly match the structure, section names, and content requirements defined in their respective template files.

## Core Principles

- Always read the template file to determine validation rules
- Never hardcode template requirements in this command - defer to templates
- Templates are the single source of truth for structure and content
- Section names must match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Required sections are listed in the template header comment
- Optional sections are marked with "(optional)" in the template
- Report all issues with clear, actionable feedback
- Only modify files when `--autofix` flag is provided
- Preserve existing content and style when autofixing

## Instructions

1. **Determine Files to Validate**

   If paths are provided via `$ARGUMENTS`:
   - For each file path: validate that file directly
   - For each directory path: find all `.md` files within

   If no paths provided:
   - Scan `plugins/*/commands/**/*.md` (excluding README.md)
   - Scan `plugins/*/agents/**/*.md` (excluding README.md)
   - Scan `plugins/*/skills/**/*.md` (excluding README.md)
   - Scan `plugins/*/hooks/**/*.md` (excluding README.md)
   - Scan `plugins/*/README.md` for plugin README validation
   - Also scan `.claude/commands/*.md` and `.claude/skills/*.md`

2. **Classify Each File and Load Template**

   Determine the file type based on location and load the corresponding template:

   | File Location | Type | Template to Read |
   |---------------|------|------------------|
   | `*/commands/**/*.md` (not README) | Command | `docs/templates/command-template.md` |
   | `*/agents/**/*.md` (not README) | Agent | `docs/templates/agent-template.md` |
   | `*/skills/**/*.md` (not README) | Skill | `docs/templates/skill-template.md` |
   | `plugins/*/README.md` | README | `docs/templates/readme-template.md` |

   Skip files that cannot be classified (not in a recognized directory).

3. **Parse Template Structure**

   Read the template file and extract:
   - **Header comment**: Contains REQUIRED SECTIONS, OPTIONAL SECTIONS, and SECTION ORDER
   - **Frontmatter fields**: Parse the `---` block to identify required fields
   - **Section names**: Extract all `## Section Name` headings
   - **Section order**: Note the order sections appear in the template
   - **Optional markers**: Sections with "(optional)" in their heading

4. **Validate Frontmatter**

   For prompt files (commands, agents, skills):
   - Parse the YAML frontmatter from the file being validated
   - Compare against frontmatter fields defined in the template
   - Validate:
     - All required fields are present
     - `name` field uses kebab-case
     - `description` is a one-line description (under 100 characters recommended)
     - Field values match expected formats from template

   For README files:
   - READMEs do not have frontmatter - skip this step

5. **Validate Section Structure**

   Compare the file's sections against the template:
   - Extract all `## ` level headings from the file
   - Compare against required sections from template header comment
   - Check for:
     - Missing required sections
     - Misspelled or incorrectly capitalized section names
     - Sections in wrong order (compared to template order)
     - Unexpected sections not in template

   For README files, also check:
   - Prompt sections (Commands, Agents, Skills, Hooks) are only present if plugin has those prompts
   - Optional sections are only present when applicable (per template instructions)

6. **Validate Section Content**

   Based on template HTML comments, validate content patterns:
   - **Instructions section**: Should contain numbered list (1. 2. 3. etc.)
   - **Core Principles section**: Should contain bullet points
   - **Arguments section**: Should contain bullet points with argument formatting
   - Check for ASCII-only content (no special Unicode characters)
   - Verify `{{placeholders}}` are replaced with actual values
   - Verify HTML comments from template are removed

7. **Apply Autofix (if `--autofix` flag is present)**

   When `--autofix` is specified:

   **Frontmatter fixes:**
   - Add missing frontmatter block if absent
   - Add missing required fields with sensible defaults derived from:
     - `name`: Derive from filename (convert to kebab-case)
     - `description`: Use first paragraph or heading as basis
     - Other fields: Use defaults from template examples

   **Structure fixes:**
   - Add missing required sections by copying placeholder from template
   - Insert sections in the correct order as defined in template
   - Mark added sections with `<!-- TODO: Fill in this section -->` comments
   - Rename incorrectly capitalized sections to match template exactly

   **Content fixes:**
   - Convert non-kebab-case names to kebab-case in frontmatter
   - Replace non-ASCII characters with ASCII equivalents
   - Preserve all existing content

   **Autofix principles:**
   - Always read both the file and the template before modifying
   - Preserve all existing content
   - Report each modification made

8. **Generate Report**

   For each file, report:
   - File path and detected type
   - Template being validated against
   - List of issues found (if any):
     - Missing frontmatter fields
     - Missing required sections
     - Section name mismatches
     - Sections in wrong order
     - Content format issues
   - Suggested fixes (validate-only mode) or modifications applied (autofix mode)

   Summary at end:
   - Total files checked
   - Files passing validation
   - Files with issues (by category)
   - Files modified (if autofix enabled)
