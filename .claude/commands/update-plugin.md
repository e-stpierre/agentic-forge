# Update Plugin Version Command

Analyze changes in the current branch compared to main and update plugin versions accordingly.

## Objective

Detect changed plugins, analyze the nature of changes, update CHANGELOGs, and update version numbers appropriately following semantic versioning.

## Core Principles

- Follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- MAJOR: Breaking changes, API changes, removed features
- MINOR: New commands, new functions, new capabilities
- PATCH: Bug fixes, documentation updates, minor improvements
- Update CHANGELOG before updating version numbers
- Marketplace version follows the highest change level across all plugins

## Instructions

1. **Detect Changed Plugins**

   Run `git diff main...HEAD --name-only` to get all changed files.

   Identify which plugins have changes by looking for files under `plugins/*/` directories.

2. **Analyze Changes for Each Plugin**

   For each changed plugin, examine the diff to determine the change type:
   - **MAJOR** (breaking changes): API changes, removed features, incompatible changes
   - **MINOR** (new features): New commands, new functions, new capabilities
   - **PATCH** (bug fixes): Bug fixes, documentation updates, minor improvements

   Use `git diff main...HEAD -- plugins/<plugin-name>/` to see the specific changes.

3. **Version Update Rules**

   Current version format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
   - MAJOR: Increment first number, reset others to 0 (e.g., 1.2.3 -> 2.0.0)
   - MINOR: Increment second number, reset patch to 0 (e.g., 1.2.3 -> 1.3.0)
   - PATCH: Increment third number (e.g., 1.2.3 -> 1.2.4)

4. **Update Plugin CHANGELOG (For Each Changed Plugin)**

   Update `plugins/<plugin-name>/CHANGELOG.md` with the new version entry:

   ```markdown
   ## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD

   ### Added

   - New feature or command (if applicable)

   ### Changed

   - Modified behavior or updated functionality (if applicable)

   ### Fixed

   - Bug fix description (if applicable)

   ### Removed

   - Removed feature or command (if applicable)
   ```

   Guidelines:
   - Use today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format
   - Only include relevant sections (Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed)
   - Keep entries concise using bullet points
   - Place new version entry at the top, below the header

5. **Update Plugin Version in Marketplace**

   After updating the CHANGELOG, update the plugin's version in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:
   - Find the plugin entry in the `plugins` array
   - Update its `version` field to the new version
   - If `plugins/<plugin-name>/pyproject.toml` exists, also update the `version` field in `[project]` section

   **Version Synchronization Requirement**: When a plugin has both a marketplace.json entry and a pyproject.toml file, both versions MUST be updated to the same value. The pyproject.toml version analysis is independent from Claude prompt changes - the plugin as a whole should always have a single consistent version across all version declarations.

6. **Update Marketplace Root Version**

   After all plugin versions are updated, update the root `metadata.version` in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:
   - Determine the highest change level across all modified plugins:
     - If ANY plugin has a MAJOR change: increment marketplace MAJOR version
     - If ANY plugin has a MINOR change (and no MAJOR): increment marketplace MINOR version
     - If ALL plugins have PATCH changes only: increment marketplace PATCH version

   Example: 3 plugins changed (2 patch, 1 minor) -> marketplace MINOR version +1

7. **Commit Version Updates**

   Use the /git-commit command to commit with message format:

   Single plugin:

   ```
   Bump <plugin-name> version to X.Y.Z (<change-type>)
   ```

   Multiple plugins:

   ```
   Bump plugin versions

   - <plugin1>: X.Y.Z (minor)
   - <plugin2>: A.B.C (patch)
   ```

## Output Guidance

Report the analysis and version changes:

```
## Plugin Version Updates

### Changed Plugins Detected
- plugin-name: [change type] (files changed: X)

### CHANGELOG Updates
- plugin-name: Added entry for vX.Y.Z

### Version Updates Applied
| Plugin | Old Version | New Version | Change Type |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| plugin-name | 1.2.3 | 1.3.0 | minor |
| marketplace | 0.1.0 | 0.2.0 | minor |
