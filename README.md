# 🧠 claude-plugins

A modular collection of commands, sub-agents, skills, and hooks designed to extend and customize Claude Code for both generic and specialized development scenarios.

This repository provides a plug-and-play framework to define reusable automation units — from lightweight code utilities to fully autonomous agent behaviors — that enhance Claude's coding workflow, environment integration, and project orchestration capabilities.

## 🚀 Features

### 📦 Command Packs

Ready-to-use slash commands for automation, scripting, and file manipulation. Commands provide quick access to common development workflows and can be composed to build complex automation pipelines.

- **Quick Actions**: Instant access to frequently-used development tasks
- **Composable**: Chain commands together for powerful workflows
- **Context-Aware**: Commands can adapt based on project context

### 🤖 Sub-Agents

Specialized agent personalities and workflows for focused domains. Sub-agents bring domain expertise and autonomous task execution to specific problem areas.

- **Domain Experts**: DevOps, testing, code review, documentation, and more
- **Autonomous Workflows**: Let specialized agents handle complex multi-step tasks
- **Customizable Behavior**: Configure agent personalities and capabilities

### 🧩 Skill Modules

Composable building blocks for logic, data processing, and system interaction. Skills are reusable components that agents and commands can leverage.

- **Reusable Logic**: Share common functionality across commands and agents
- **Extensible**: Build new skills on top of existing ones
- **Interoperable**: Skills work seamlessly with all plugin types

### 🔌 Hooks

Extend Claude Code's runtime behavior to inject context, monitor state, or adapt responses dynamically. Hooks enable event-driven customization of the development environment.

- **Event-Driven**: React to session start, tool calls, and other events
- **State Monitoring**: Track and respond to changes in your development environment
- **Dynamic Context**: Inject relevant information based on current state

### ⚙️ Configuration Templates

Easily register or override behaviors for project-specific use cases. Templates provide starting points for common development scenarios.

- **Quick Setup**: Bootstrap new projects with pre-configured plugins
- **Shareable**: Distribute configurations across teams
- **Adaptable**: Override defaults for project-specific needs

## 🎯 Goal

Create a flexible ecosystem where developers can configure, share, and evolve Claude Code capabilities to suit diverse project needs — from local coding assistants to distributed AI agents.

By providing a standardized way to package and distribute Claude Code extensions, this repository aims to:

- **Lower the barrier** to customizing Claude Code for specific workflows
- **Enable knowledge sharing** of best practices and automation patterns
- **Foster a community** of Claude Code power users and plugin developers
- **Accelerate development** by providing reusable, battle-tested components

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Claude Code CLI installed and configured
- Basic familiarity with Claude Code concepts (commands, agents, hooks)
- Git authentication configured for private repositories (if applicable)

### Installation

Add this repository as a plugin marketplace in Claude Code:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add e-stpierre/claude-plugins
```

**For private repositories**: Ensure you have proper Git authentication configured (SSH keys or GitHub personal access token).

### Browse & Install Plugins

Once the marketplace is added, browse and install plugins using the plugin menu:

```bash
/plugin menu
```

This opens an interactive menu where you can:

- Browse all available plugins from the marketplace
- View plugin descriptions and capabilities
- Install plugins directly to your project
- Manage installed plugins

### Marketplace Versioning

#### Latest Version

Install the latest version of the marketplace:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add e-stpierre/claude-plugins
```

#### Specific Version

Install a specific version using git tags:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add e-stpierre/claude-plugins#v1.1.0
```

#### Update Marketplace

Update the marketplace to the latest version:

```bash
/plugin marketplace update claude-plugins
```

#### Remove Marketplace

Remove the marketplace from your configuration:

```bash
/plugin marketplace remove claude-plugins
```

**⚠️ Warning**: Removing a marketplace will uninstall all plugins from that marketplace. This is useful when you need to install a previous version of the marketplace or its plugins.

### Install Specific Plugins

You can also install specific plugins directly by name:

```bash
/plugin install appsec
```

### Usage

After installation, plugins are immediately available in your Claude Code session:

- **Commands**: Available via `/command-name` (e.g., `/security-review`)
- **Agents**: Invoked automatically via commands or Task tool
- **Skills**: Activated via `Skill` tool or skill name
- **Hooks**: Execute automatically on configured events

Refer to individual plugin documentation for specific usage instructions and examples.
