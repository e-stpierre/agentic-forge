The following sections are optional and can be added in `CLAUDE.md` to improve it's integration with the `agenti-sdlc` plugin.

## Checkpoint Guidelines

Create checkpoints using `/create-checkpoint` when:

- Completing a milestone in implementation
- About to hand off to another session
- Encountering issues that need documentation
