      # Demo Workflow Complete

      The agentic-sdlc demo workflow has finished executing.

      Please verify the following:
      1. Two files were created: demo-1.md and demo-2.md at the repository root
      2. No permission errors occurred during execution

      If everything succeeded, say:
      "DEMO WORKFLOW COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY - Your agentic-sdlc installation is working correctly!"

      Remind the user to delete demo-1.md and demo-2.md after reviewing them.

      IMPORTANT: If any permission issues occurred during this workflow, report them now
      and end with: "DEMO WORKFLOW COMPLETED WITH ISSUES - Please review the errors above."
