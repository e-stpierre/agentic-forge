# Feature Plan Reference

## Planning Approach

Feature plans focus on comprehensive design with incremental delivery. Each milestone should be independently valuable and testable. Architecture decisions should align with existing codebase patterns.

## Key Sections

A feature plan should include:

1. **Overview**: What the feature does and why it's valuable
2. **Requirements**: Functional and non-functional requirements
3. **Architecture**: High-level design and patterns to use
4. **Milestones**: Logical breakdown with tasks
5. **Testing Strategy**: How the feature will be tested
6. **Validation Criteria**: How to verify the feature is complete

## Requirements Gathering

Capture both types of requirements:

**Functional Requirements**:
- What the feature should do
- User interactions and flows
- Input/output specifications
- Edge cases and error handling

**Non-Functional Requirements**:
- Performance expectations
- Security considerations
- Scalability needs
- Accessibility requirements
- Compatibility constraints

## Architecture Considerations

When designing the feature:

- Study existing patterns in the codebase
- Identify integration points with existing code
- Define data models and API contracts
- Consider component reusability
- Plan for extensibility without over-engineering
- Document key technical decisions

## Milestone Design

Break features into logical milestones:

- Each milestone should deliver visible progress
- Milestones should be testable independently
- Order by dependency (foundational first)
- Keep milestones small enough to complete in 1-3 sessions
- Typically 2-5 milestones per feature

**Common milestone patterns**:
1. Core infrastructure/data models
2. Basic functionality (happy path)
3. Edge cases and error handling
4. Polish and optimization
5. Documentation and cleanup

## Task Decomposition

Within each milestone:

- Tasks should be specific and actionable
- Include file paths where changes are needed
- Consider testing tasks alongside implementation
- Note any dependencies between tasks

## Testing Strategy

Plan testing at multiple levels:

- **Unit Tests**: Individual functions and components
- **Integration Tests**: Component interactions
- **E2E Tests**: Full user flows
- **Manual Testing**: Exploratory and edge cases
