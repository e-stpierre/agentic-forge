# Bug Fix Plan Reference

## Planning Approach

Bug fix plans focus on thorough root cause analysis and prevention of regression. Understanding the cause is critical to implementing an effective fix.

## Key Sections

A bug fix plan should include:

1. **Description**: Clear explanation of the bug and its impact
2. **Reproduction Steps**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the bug
3. **Root Cause Analysis**: Technical explanation of why the bug occurs
4. **Fix Strategy**: High-level approach to fixing the bug
5. **Tasks**: Specific implementation tasks
6. **Validation**: Steps to verify the fix works
7. **Testing**: Test cases to prevent regression

## Investigation Focus

When analyzing a bug:

- Trace the execution path that leads to the bug
- Identify the specific conditions that trigger it
- Look for related code paths that may have similar issues
- Check if there are existing tests that should have caught this
- Understand the impact scope (which users/features are affected)

## Root Cause Categories

Common root causes to investigate:

- **Logic Errors**: Incorrect conditions, off-by-one errors, wrong operators
- **State Management**: Race conditions, stale data, incorrect state transitions
- **Error Handling**: Unhandled exceptions, silent failures, missing edge cases
- **Integration Issues**: API contract violations, data format mismatches
- **Configuration**: Environment-specific issues, missing settings
- **Resource Management**: Memory leaks, connection exhaustion, deadlocks

## Fix Strategy Guidelines

- Address the root cause, not just symptoms
- Consider defensive measures to prevent similar bugs
- Avoid fixes that introduce new complexity
- Prefer targeted changes over broad refactoring
- Include test coverage for the specific failure case

## Milestone Structure

Bug fixes typically have 2-3 milestones:

1. **Investigation & Setup**: Reproduce bug, identify root cause, prepare environment
2. **Implementation**: Apply fix, handle edge cases
3. **Validation & Testing**: Verify fix, add regression tests
