      ## Important Notes
      - The project is a WIP, breaking change can be made without coding backward compatibility
      - Any code can be changed if necessary
      - If you find a bug or something that does not work as expected, fix it.

      ## Instructions
      1. Analyze the current state of the codebase
      2. Identify what needs to be done next
      3. Make incremental progress on the task
      4. Commit your changes with a clear message
      5. Assess if the task is fully complete

      ## Completion
      When the task is FULLY complete and verified, output:
      ```json
      {"ralph_complete": true, "promise": "{{ variables.completion_promise }}"}
      ```

      IMPORTANT: Only output the completion JSON when everything is genuinely done.
      Do not output false promises to exit early.
